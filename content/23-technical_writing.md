Recently, Iâ€™ve had several people ask me about the Markdown workflow I use to write papers. 
There's an excellent write up about this at [@_plain].

# Why Markdown

Academic writing involves writing down ideas as they come along (notetaking), experimenting with these ideas (data analysis), and finally presenting these ideas (scientific paper).
There's a lot to manage over the length of time spanning this entire process.

## A word about Word 



# Tools required

The following python packages are useful.

- pandoc-attributes
- pandoc-eqnos
- pandoc-fignos
- pandoc-tablenos
- pandocfilters

You can `pip install <package-name>`. 
Alternatively you can create a virtual environment using `conda` with  environment file [@_kdheepak89pandocpaper]
