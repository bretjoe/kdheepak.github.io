Recently, Iâ€™ve had several people ask me about the Markdown workflow I use to write papers. 
Hopefully this discussion will get people interested in this workflow, and show them how to get started using the same or a similar workflow.
There's an excellent write up about this at [@_plain_2015].

Academic writing involves writing down ideas as they come along (notetaking), experimenting with these ideas (data analysis), and finally presenting these ideas (scientific paper).
There's a lot to manage over the length of time spanning this entire process.
