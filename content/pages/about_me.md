I’m an electrical engineer. I’ve also dabbled with mobile application and web development, home automation and photography. I’m currently working towards a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering.

I love visiting and reading up on the history of places. My dream is that one day I’d have travelled to every country in the world. (Four down, 192 to go!) I love watching movies and having discussions with friends about them. I’ve been on the seemingly never ending quest of completing IMDb’s top 250 movies of all time for almost forever. (An embarrassingly small 91 down, 159 to go.) I love reading books and comic books. I love technology an extraordinarily unusual amount and even occasionally contribute to a technology news and media network. Check them out [here](http://unleashthephones.com/), they are really cool!

On this website, I intend to share interesting projects I’m currently working on or have worked on in the past, also as a way of establishing an archive. If you find anything interesting, feel absolutely free to email me, or contact me on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.
