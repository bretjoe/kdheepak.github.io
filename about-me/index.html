        <h3>About Me</h3>

		<p>It is surprisingly hard to introduce yourself to people. You (usually) know yourself quite well, and more often that not, you don’t exactly&nbsp;know where to begin. I know I will do no justice to the purpose this page, but nonetheless, an attempt I shall make. I could begin by questioning if a single ‘About Me’ page is enough to provide a legitimate personal history to my sufficient satisfaction, but I’m not entirely comfortable with playing around with the idea of claiming that I’m so interestingly complex that I cannot be summarized on what could be a virtually limitless&nbsp;webpage. I guess I’m just modest like that. </p>
<p><img alt="Alt text! And a picture of me!" src="http://kdheepak.com/images/coverPicture.jpg" width="100%" > </p>
<p>I’m an electrical engineer. I’ve also dabbled with mobile application and web development, home automation and photography.&nbsp;I’m currently working towards a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I love visiting and reading up on the history of places. My dream is that one day I’d have travelled to every country in the world. (Four down, 192 to go!) I love watching movies and having discussions with friends about them. I’ve been on the seemingly never ending quest of completing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" target="_blank">IMDb’s&nbsp;top 250 movies of all time</a>&nbsp;for almost forever. (An embarrassingly&nbsp;small 91 down, 159 to go.) I love reading books and comic books, but I find I’m particularly picky about what I choose to read, especially with the latter.&nbsp;I love technology an extraordinarily unusual amount and even occasionally contribute to a technology news and media network. Check them out <a href="http://www.unleashthephones.com/">here</a>, they are really cool! </p>
<p>On this website, I intend to share interesting projects I’m currently working on or have worked on in the past, also as a way of establishing an archive. I hope to document everything as meticulously as I can. If you find anything interesting, feel absolutely free to email me, or contact me on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.</p>
